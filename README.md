# fmc-ranks
Small program to optimize creation of images from a raw text containing Fewest Moves results copied from the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1422080808012720). You can check a live version of this repo [here](https://campos20.github.io/fmc-ranks/).

## Getting started

- This is a web version of [Guido Dipietro's tool](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/FMCranks).
- Download this repo and open the `index.html` page using Firefox (Chrome gives trouble because of the `import` JavaScript feature).
- Paste the raw copy from the results (names, attempts...) and click `Generate table`. View [wiki](https://github.com/campos20/fmc-ranks/wiki) for a little more.
- After the table is generated, click in `Donwload image` to save the image in your device.
