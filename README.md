# fmc-ranks
Small program to optimize creation of images from a raw text containing Fewest Moves results copied from the [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1422080808012720).

## Getting started

- This is a web version of [Guido Dipietro's tool](https://github.com/GuidoDipietro/FMCranks).
- Download this repo and open the `index.html` page using Firefox (Chrome gives trouble because of the `import` JavaScript feature).
- Paste the raw copy from the results (names, attempts...) and click `Generate image`
- Since this is not finished, you'll need to open the console to see what is happening. As of today, it calculates averages, sorts competitors and display it all (on console). Once this is finished, an option to download the image will be available.
- Open the console with ctrl+shift+k or inspect element and look for the console
